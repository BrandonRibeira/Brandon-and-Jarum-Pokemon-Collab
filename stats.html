    <h1>Pokemon Stats</h1>
    <p>Pokemon each have six stats, as seen above on the chart. HP stands for "health points", but the rest are mostly self-explainatory. attack and defense are for move wit the physical attribute, such as a punch, or a boulder hurled at the enemy, but the "special" stats are relevant to moves with a "special" attribute, such as a supernatural attack using psychic powers. Inferring the rest, the defensive stats reduce damage from their listed attribute, the attack stats increase damage dealt by attacks of their attribute, HP increases their total health, and speed determines which combatant moves first in a battle.</p>
