    <h1>Type Matchups</h1>
    <p>Every individual pokemon has up to two "types". these determine their weaknesses, resistances and invulnerabilities, though rare, to other typings. <br> for instance, fighting types are known to be strong against rock, ice, normal, steel and dark. <br> this is because those things could be considered especially vulnerable to physical violence. <br> However, you cannot punch a ghost, so fighting attacks won't deal damage to ghost-types. Further, for less intuitive reasons, it's hard to punch birds, ESPers, bugs, poison and fairies. <br> i'll let you figure out why. for more questions, you can consult the graph above.</p>
