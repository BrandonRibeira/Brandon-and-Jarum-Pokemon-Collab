    <h1>Inherited Values ("IVs")</h1>
    <p>Pokemon all come with hidden stats that are pseudo-random once they're obtained from the wild. when bred, those pokemon have a chance to pass on their genes, or IVs, onto their offspring, with room for simulated genetic mutation. In essence, IVs will alter the possible maximum or minimum stat bands (in reference to HP, attack, defense, etc.) which that pokemon can have. In modern pokemon games, starting with Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield, you can offer "bottle caps" (for reasons beyond my comprehension) that allow your pokemon to undergo training that will max out that pokemon's base IV stats.</p>
