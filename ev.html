    <h1>Effort Values ("EVs")</h1>
    <p>Effort Values determine a Pokemon's final stats. They are gained by defeating pokemon, adding a layer of individual touch to commemorate a journey with any little creatures you may have grown attached to along your journey. EVs are gained by defeating pokemon, and which stat increases is dependent on the highest base stat (before IVs, EVs, etc.) of the wild pokemon, in increments of between 1 and 3, dependent on the evolution status of the pokemon. the maximum any given stat total can be is 255, and for each pokemon, you can get up to 510 total EVs across the pokemon's entire "lifespan", for lack of better term. There are also in-game items such as supplemental vitamins, which add 10 per, and feathers, which add 1 per.</p>
